Part1{
[sh,The General][abf,6][ss, .05]
[c] Ahem...[w, .2] I've gathered you all here so that I may debrief on how the warrior dogs' subjugation of the monsters is fairing. [wi]
[c] As you all know, all of dogkind has suffered tremendous loss... [wi]
[c] Of fellow dogâ€”[w,.2]whether that be your town's grocer,[w,.1] a neighbor,[w,.1] friend,[w,.1] or even a family member... [wi]
[c] And of the very lands upon which we built our homes over the decades past that this blight has persisted since. [wi]
[c] So that now, all that remains for us to safeguard is this very town,[w, .1] the one and only,[w, .1] final place that we can call home.[wi]
[c] However, the monsters outside stand to make that mission very difficult, as they've been closing in on us in recent years.[wi]
[c] For such a state of affairs, I must issue an apology to every one of my fellow townspeople.[wi]
[c] As your General,[w,.1] and on behalf of my dogs' recent failings,[w,.1] I have let every single one of you down.[wi]
[c] Our battle,[w,.1] or more accurately rebuff,[w,.1] against the monsters hasn't been proceeding as smoothly as I'd like.[wi]
[c] Multiple times over just this past month, I have received reports of monsters getting more elusive and coordinated in their onslaught.[wi]
[c] So much so that...[w, .2] worst of all...[w, .2] one of our very own warriors has yet to return from their outing... [wi] [exit]

Part2{
[sh,The General][abf,6][ss, .05][c] We may not know the exact fiend that got to him...[wi]
[c] [bgm, Prologue.Triumphant, 1] But I am here to promise you that,[w, .1] with renewed vigor,[w, .1] my warriors shall find out why and locate where the current surge of monsters is originating and eliminate them so that this town may for once know tranquility![wi] [exit]
